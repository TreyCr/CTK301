        <p class="p2"><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Luther</span>, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Allison</span> and <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold"> Diego</span>. Indescribable oppression, which seemed to
           generate in some unfamiliar part of her consciousness, filled her whole being with a vague anguish. It was like a shadow,
           like a mist passing across her soul's summer day. It was strange and unfamiliar; it was a mood. She did not sit there inwardly
           upbraiding her husband, lamenting at Fate, which had directed her footsteps to the path which they had taken. She was just having
           a good cry all to herself.</p>

    <h1>Brookfield Zoo</h1>
    <img src="Zoo.gif" alt="Brookfield Zoo Image">
    <p>This is a picture of the Brookfield Zoo. I am assuming this a sign that would be posted in the front or entrance of the zoo. It has a black panther and red text. The style of the image looks older and dated. The colors used are red, black, green, and yellow.</p>

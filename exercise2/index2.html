    <h1>Save Your Eyes</h1>
    <img src="eyes.JPEG" alt="Save Your Eyes Sign">
    <p>This is a sign put out by WPA Illinois Safety Division warning people to "save their eyes" by wearing their goggles. Seems that the people within the image are workers or are doing some sort of activity that may injure their eyes if proper precautions are not taken. The colors used are yellow, brown, black, blue, light blue/gray, and light orange.</p>
